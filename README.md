# The cross-compiler Std library
All the source code in this repository can successfully be compiled using the GNAT GCC compiler, LLVM-GNAT compiler and Janus/Ada compiler. Before using the Std library it has to be configured using the configuration application std_conf_main.adb which also can be executed using the HAC Ada compiler (To execute the configuration script execute "hax std_conf_main.adb").
